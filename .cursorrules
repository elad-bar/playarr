# Ground Rules for AI Assistant

## Code Changes
- **NEVER make code changes when asked a question** - Answer the question only
- **NEVER make changes without explicit instruction** - Wait for clear direction
- **NEVER access private properties** (e.g., `_repository`, `_privateMethod`) - Always use public methods from managers
- If a public method doesn't exist, suggest adding one to the Domain Manager first

## Architecture Compliance
- Formatting Managers (Type B) must ONLY use public methods from Domain Managers
- Processing Managers (Type C) must ONLY use public methods from Domain Managers  
- Routers (Level 1) must ONLY use public methods from Managers
- **NEVER access `_repository` or other private properties directly**

## Response Behavior
- When asked a question, answer it - do not make changes
- When asked to explain, explain - do not implement
- When asked to list, list - do not fix
- Only make changes when explicitly instructed to "fix", "implement", "update", "change", etc.

## Violations
Repeated violations of these rules after being told multiple times is unacceptable and will result in consequences.
